Notes

1. The Square could be divided into several [zones] of about 10mÂ². 
- Either specify the bounds with <= and >=
- Or determine distance from a centre point. If person is within x metres from point, choose from this pool. If not close enough to any pool, play transition sounds?


2. When the participant enters one of these [zones] and [stands still] (something we can detect through GPS), one of several (say, 10 or 20) [zone audio] files plays.
- If {person is in zone} and {speed is less than ~1-0.5mph}
- Then determine what audio file to play
- Fade from current audio to new audio


3. When the participant begins [moving] again, there could be a [fade] into a [walking audio] which would then transition out to a new [ zone audio] from the zone's selection.
- If {speed is greater than ~1-0.5mph}
- Then fade from current sound into transition audio


STATES {

- Standing still = zone audio
- Transitioning = fading between zone and walking audio
- Walking = walking audio
}

VARIABLES {

- Float: GPS Longitude
- Float: GPS Latitude
- Boolean: inParliamentSquare
- Boolean: Zone 1 (occupied or not) (if GPS Long & Lat is within x and y)
- Boolean: Zone 2 (occupied or not) (if GPS Long & Lat is within x and y)
- Boolean: Zone 3 (occupied or not) (if GPS Long & Lat is within x and y)
- Boolean: Zone 4 (occupied or not) (if GPS Long & Lat is within x and y)

- Float: Speed: If speed >= 1 then walking = true.
- Boolean: Walking (true or false)
